## PingScan

This script performs a `ping` command to every single network host on an IP range. This uses the `subprocess`
Python module that presents as an OS API for Python. The whole idea is to evaluate if it can be accessible from "the attacker" perspective

Internally, the `pingscan.py` script handles the program workflow and exceptions if they occur.

For each IP address, the script runs a `ping -c 1 [IP]` and attempts to get an `ECHO_REPLY` (ICMP Protocol response) to whatever IP is on the network segment available. The `ECHO_REPLY` is evaluated on a string comparison of the `stdout` Pipe.

The `ping` command uses the `ICMP protocol`, which basically is a message protocol to get to know if a machine is available/active or not. The client does a `ECHO_REQUEST` and the requested machine will respond to a `ECHO_REPLY` object to it.

## WorkFlow

Basically, the subprocess module sets up like an interface (`Popen class`) to the terminal, this does the `ping` command and waits for the response. Any program product is handled by `pipes` for errors, input, and output.

## Usage

`python 192.168.1` or any of the network segments reachable.
